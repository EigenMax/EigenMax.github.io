As my third year of college starts to wrap up, I decided to reflect on the classes I've taken as a Computer Science major and document my thoughts about them here. Hopefully, someday, some UW CSE student will find this and use this as another resource for picking classes. 

For some additional context, I started UW in September 2017, and took my first CSE class in Winter '18. Since then, I've taken a total of 13 CSE classes, and maintained a ~3.8 GPA in these classes. I'm going to separate these courses in __ categories (Intro, ). Feel free to skip around :)

# Intro: 
## CSE 142 
> Teacher       : Whitaker Brand

> Grade received: 4.0

> Approval Score: 90% 

> Fun Fact      : I also TAed this class

To be honest, I wasn't sure if I should have taken this class. I already took AP Computer Science in high school, which meant I could skip ahead to take CSE 143 instead. Despite my worries, I enrolled in it due to advice on Reddit that said it would help with "style points." For those of you that don't know what that means, "style points" are basically points allocated to students' homework scores based on how clean and concise their code is. You are generally awarded points for following the rules on their style guide, as well as by making sure you apply the concepts you learned in class to your homework. Honestly speaking, the grading system used can be quite brutal, and I've seen many students lose points for very trivial things. 

For me, the idea behind taking this class was that I could focus on learning how to write good clean code without having to worry about the concepts they teach in this class because I already knew most of the concepts taught. In my opinion, it turned out to be a good choice as I learned a lot about how to write good code (and I also got a good grade). If you're thinking about taking this class, the main factors to consider are:
- Are you comfortable with the content (variables, parameters/returns, loops, arrays, OOP etc)
- Do you think you write good clean code?
- How much practice do you want before you take CSE 143 (assuming you do take it)

## CSE 143
⋅⋅⋅Teacher       : Stuart Reges⋅⋅
> Grade received: 4.0

Stuart is a phenomenal instructor, and I'm extremely glad I got to take the class under him. He made lectures really easy to understand, and I felt he taught me a lot about programming. In terms of course content, you learn about stacks/queues, linkedlists, maps, as well as about how some of these data structures are implemented. I thought it was a great way to learn about Object-Oriented Programming, and I really recommend anyone even slightly interested in programming to take this course. You learn that there's a lot more to programming than just what you learn in CSE 142 (which, in my opinion, is really limited and fairly mundane). You also learn to program a lot of cool projects in your homeworks, which was nice as well. In terms of difficulty, you have to dedicate a good chunk of time to thinking about HOW to approach your projects. A lot of the projects you complete don't have an easy "correct solution," and you'll have to spend a lot of time thinking about how to implement your code. On the flip side, it was also easier to structure your projects because they tell you what sort of methods and constructors you need in your homework. Other than that, as long as you stay on top of your homework, I think you'll enjoy taking this course.
