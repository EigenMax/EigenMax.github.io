As my third year of college starts to wrap up, I decided to reflect on the classes I've taken as a Computer Science major and document my thoughts about them here. Hopefully, someday, some UW CSE student will find this and use this as another resource for picking classes. 

For some additional context, I started UW in September 2017, and took my first CSE class in Winter '18. Since then, I've taken a total of 13 CSE classes, and maintained a ~3.8 GPA in these classes. I'm going to separate these courses in 3 categories (Intro, Cores, and Electives). Feel free to look around :)

# Intro: 
--- 
### CSE 142: Computer Programming I
- Teacher       : Whitaker Brand
- Grade received: 4.0
- Approval Score: 70% 
- Fun Fact      : I also TAed this class

To be honest, I wasn't sure if I should have taken this class. I already took AP Computer Science in high school, which meant I could skip ahead to take CSE 143 instead. Despite my worries, I enrolled in it due to advice on Reddit that said it would help with "style points." For those of you that don't know what that means, "style points" are basically points allocated to students' homework scores based on how clean and concise their code is. You are generally awarded points for following the rules on their style guide, as well as by making sure you apply the concepts you learned in class to your homework. Honestly speaking, the grading system can be quite brutal, and I've seen many students lose points for very trivial things. 

For me, the idea behind taking this class was that I could focus on learning how to write good clean code without having to worry about the concepts they teach in this class. In my opinion, it turned out to be a good choice as I learned a lot about how to write good code (and I also got a good grade). If you're thinking about taking this class, the main factors to consider are:
- Are you comfortable with the content (variables, parameters/returns, loops, arrays, OOP etc)
- Do you think you write good clean code?
- How much practice do you want before you take CSE 143 (assuming you do take it)

### CSE 143: Computer Programming II
- Teacher       : Stuart Reges
- Grade received: 4.0
- Approval Score: 95% 
- Fun Fact      : I also TAed this class

Stuart is a phenomenal instructor, and I'm extremely glad I got to take the class under him. He made lectures really easy to understand, and I felt he taught me a lot about programming. In terms of course content, you learn about stacks/queues, linkedlists, maps, as well as about how some of these data structures are implemented. I thought it was a great way to learn about Object-Oriented Programming, and I really recommend anyone even slightly interested in programming to take this course. You learn that there's a lot more to programming than just what you learn in CSE 142 (which, in my opinion, is really limited and fairly mundane). You also learn to program a lot of cool projects in your homeworks, which was nice as well. In terms of difficulty, you have to dedicate a good chunk of time to thinking about HOW to approach your projects. A lot of the projects you complete don't have an easy "correct solution," and you'll have to spend a lot of time thinking about how to implement your code. On the flip side, it was also easier to structure your projects because they tell you what sort of methods and constructors you need in your homework. Other than that, as long as you stay on top of your homework, I think you'll enjoy taking this course. 


# You're a CSE Major... Now what?

Let's talk requirements...

### CSE 311: Foundations of Computing I
- Teacher       : Kevin Zatloukal
- Grade received: 3.8
- Approval Score: 75% 

This was the first class I took as an in-major CSE student. While my grade doesn't reflect it, I struggled a lot in this class. Before taking this class, I took PHIL 120, which was the baby class version of CSE 311. As such, I knew about some of the concepts taught in CSE 311 before taking it... and it only helped me for the first 3 weeks of class. In my experience, this class is fast-paced and intense. When you don't understand something, you better catch up fast or you'll get left behind. At this point, I'm not really sure why the CSE department course a requirement course because I'm pretty positive I could survive/succeed as a CS major without having ever taken this class. 

The earlier concepts taught in this class (boolean logic/algebra, proofs) were very interesting, but, some of the later concepts (regular expressions, DFA/NFAs) seemed abstract and I found it hard to grasp. I didn't like it. Looking back on it, the class is probably geared towards studying Computer Science as a field, not about studying programming (although it can definitely help with your programming skills).

### CSE 351: The Hardware/Software Interface
- Teacher       : Ruth Anderson
- Grade received: 3.8
- Approval Score: 95%

CSE 351 focuses on lower level programming. In particular, the class is mainly interested in things like memory allocation, pointers, etc. You also learn Assembly (yuck) and how to read it, as well as how computers read and interpret bits and how virtual memory works. Although everyone's experiences vary, I found the class to be really enjoyable. The homeworks weren't particularly hard, the TAs were nice, and the professor really cared about our education. There were definitely some concepts I couldn't grasp in that class, but I thought it was really cool to learn about how computers operate at the hardware/software interface, and it served as a nice segway to learn about the C programming language.

### CSE 332: Data Structures and Parallelism
- Teacher : Ruth Anderson
- Grade received: 3.8 
- Approval Score: 80%

332 really hammers in the skills you need to become a successful software engineer. The course starts off by discussing implementations of stacks and queues, and then transitions into talking about more data structures, like priority queues and B-Trees. You also learn a lot of necessary sorting algorithms, as well as how hashing works. Personally, I struggled in this class. The projects are all partner-based, which turned out to be a double-edged sword. I appreciated the idea of a partner that could bail you out and help you succeed in the class, but, at the same time, I almost felt inadequate as a programmer. I didn't take any programming courses in the previous quarter, and I felt less confident in my programming skills in comparison to my peers. Nonetheless, the course is well-designed and well-taught, and I know many students see this class as a foundational cornerstone for their careers. As for me, I'm just glad I'm done with it.

### CSE 312: Foundations of Computing II
- Teacher : Martin Tompa
- Grade received: 3.5
- Approval Score: 85%

If you asked me what my approval rating of this course was on a different day, I may have given it a 50%. When I took this class, I absolutely detested it. Of course, some of it was due to the circumstances. It was a 9:30 lecture, the teacher didn't record his lectures, and his notes were honestly unreadable. I also didn't understand the material. In a vacuum, I thought 312 was a terrible class and I am absolutely glad I never have to take it ever again. Now, however, as a third year student, I am more comfortable with the content taught in this class, and I have come to appreciate everything that I learned. The curriculum for this course goes over the foundational statistics used in computer science. The concepts taught in this course have many cool applications, like machine learning. Some of the more important concepts are independence, continuous and discrete distributions, expectations, naive bayes, and maximum likelihood estimations. These concepts are all very prevalant in the field of computer science, and having a solid foundation of these concepts can only widen your career options. Definitely take it, and definitely invest a lottttt of time in understanding the content!

### 331: Software Design and Implementation
I haven't taken it. Can't tell you what it's like but I heard it's boring. You probably don't need to invest much time in the class if you don't want to.
