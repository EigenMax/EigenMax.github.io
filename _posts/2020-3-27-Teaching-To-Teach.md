You were in the corner of the classroom when I woke up.

And I? I was laying on the ground as my students looked down on me. It happened 10 minutes before class ended. Apparently, I fainted in the middle of a presentation. My students spent the rest of class helping me get back to my feet. But not you. You spent the whole time looking at me, like a curious cat. 

The bells rang and the students filed out of the room. I had sat back down on a chair, looking to catch my breath for a few minutes before I cleared out too. And that's when you came over to me. 

"How are you feeling?" You ask.

"My knees hurt like hell," I reply. I would've acted tough if you were a student, but you were a part of my imagination. My very own King Hamlet. No point in acting tough. I try to stand back up but the anxiety, pitifullness, and fatigue all came crashing down on me. So I took my seat again.

You picked up the eraser and started cleaning the whiteboard. Diagrams of boxes and arrows reverted back to their original whiteness. You leave one last linked-list on the whiteboard.

"Thanks," I say. 

"Don't mention it." You reply.

"What brings you here?" I ask. 

"Nothing much. What do you teach?"

"Well, today's lesson plan was to go over linked lists. I was-"

"Right, but what do you teach?" you ask more firmly. *What do I teach?*, I wonder. Well, Computer Science. Introduction to Programming, to be more specific. Java. Object-Oriented Programming. 

"Problem-solving skills, I guess. And teaching to code. Yeah, programming." I say. You nod and give me a pat on the shoulder. 

What do you teach for?" You ask me, almost exasperated at this point. 

"Oh." When I was little, I used to think teaching would be cool. I remember thinking I wanted to be a teacher that would trust their students, like my fourth grade teacher, Mr. Rea. He once gave me the keys to his classroom because I had no place to read my books during lunch. He trusted I returned the keys to him before the afternoon classes started. Of course, I repaid his trust by locking the classroom door and promptly returning the keys to the front office instead. 

Or like another one of my teachers, Mr. M. His classes were often just discussions, but he always had a hidden intention behind his discussions, kind of like a secret puzzle with a hidden purpose. And when someone solved the puzzle, his forehead would wrinkle and his eyes would open wide, like a proud parent.

That was the kind of teacher I aspired to be. I wanted to always have faith in my students, and to watch endearingly as my students grew as programmers. At first, I spent hours in an empty study room, practicing my presentations over and over until I was able to nail it down. But as time progressed, that golden figure of a teacher seemed to grow dimmer and dimmer. Quarter after quarter, those aspirations whittled down. I stopped practicing my presentations. I started preparing last minute. I told myself I would be okay because I was a /seasoned TA/. 

Ultimately, it ended up in fatigue and panic, and I fainted in front of my class. 

"I guess I taught because I thought I like it," I reply. "I still do," I go on. "It's just... you spend so many hours in a week preparing for class, grading homeworks, and attending meetings. I don't know if I have it in me to do this anymore. I started doing research. I want to spend my time doing other things too, and I just don't have time to teach." I stutter on. "I wanted to know what I could learn from the experience. I wanted to learn how to teach. I wanted to learn how to present in front of others, and how to grade too." I look back up, but you were already gone. I sigh, realizing I look like a fool for talking to myself.

I stand up and grab the eraser, wiping the last linked list off the whiteboard. *I guess I don't hate teaching,* I tell myself. 

And I walked out the classroom door.
