This particular post is oriented towards reflecting on 2019 as a whole but will tailor towards the last few months, 
since recent events are on my mind the most right now :) Right now, the two biggest things on my mind are computers 
and soccer. I'll break down my thoughts into smaller subparts as well. Enjoy! 

# Computers 

## Classes 


## Internships and Interviews
