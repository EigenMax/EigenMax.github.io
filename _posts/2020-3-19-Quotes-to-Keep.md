> "intelligence lies on a multidimensional spectrum"

> "Doesn't it seem like life is just trying to bring you down? Like how expensive rent is... or how stray dogs only ever shit right in front of your house... or how the manga you waited for every week is going to finish soon. But when those realities overwhelm you, and your dream becomes clouded, that's when you die on the inside"
> Kanojo, Okarishimasu
